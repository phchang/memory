# Memory Grid Game

* The game starts by presenting a grid (N by M grid) with a subset of the elements highlighted to the end user.
* After a brief time, the grid will be flipped over, with all the elements reset and no longer highlighted.
* The user is then asked to click the positions of the cells in the grid that were highlighted, within a set period of time.
* If the user selects the correct cells, he or she will be taken on to the next stage of the game where a more challenging level is presented, by either increasing the number of the highlighted cells or by increasing the grid size, or both. The position of the highlighted cells should change with each new game level.
* If the user does not guess correctly, we will reset the cells but stay at the same level of difficulty.
* Game play will continue until the user cannot complete a level, or has reached the end of the available options.
* This should be a dynamic, front-end only web app. You should try to use the best of javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and whatever javascript / CSS framework you would like. You should honor the "Honor Code" and do not copy if you find existing examples on the web. We're looking for how you architect, organize and execute this from a coding point of view.
* Once complete, you can zip up the project or post it on github, then we can take a look at it in preparation for a discussion where you walk us through your implementation.
